My name is  Stefan Wiebe, and I'm currently a senior studying 
trombone performance and audio engineering, with minors in 
informatics and mathematics at Indiana University. 
I am originally from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 

I began to be involved with music in first grade when I started playing 
piano, and became even more involved when I picked up the trombone in 
fourth grade. In addition, I greatly enjoyed my high school classes 
in calculus and the sciences, so I saw that combining with music into 
audio engineering and music technology to accompany my performance degree. 
Music has played a big role in my life as I have attended dozens of 
festivals through PMEA and NAFME as well as summer music programs, 
school, and community ensembles.
