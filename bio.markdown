Stefan Wiebe is an audio engineer and trombone player, currently in his senior year studying at
the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University in the studio of Carl Lenthe, pursuing a double
degree in audio and performance, also minoring in mathematics and informatics. He is
originally from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Stefan has recorded many different ensembles at IU
and independently, and he is currently working towards releasing two solo CDs for Denson Paul
Pollard, trombonist in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and professor at the Jacobs School.


Performing at IU, Stefan has had the opportunity to perform with the Philharmonic, Concert,
Chamber, Symphony, and University orchestras as well as other ensembles from jazz to
symphonic bands to various chamber ensembles. He was a finalist in both the 2019 and 2020
Jacobs School brass concerto competitions. Away from the console and the trombone, Stefan
enjoys practicing piano, reading, and spending time outdoors.
